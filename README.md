# BlyatBeauty PCGen Homebrew
A repo dedicated to the PCGen Data I use at my table. This includes only the necessary game systems and data packs as well as homebrew I made.

This repo is left public for my players to easily fetch new homebrew as it's made. While you're more than free to use it, my table's issues and complaints will be prioritized over the issue tracker here.
